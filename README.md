# ArtProject
In this project I will try to analyze contemporary context of art. I'm going to start with:
- Russian art context:
  - main news channles
  - main art events

## Notebooks:
1. Sites_studies: for creating a dictionary of sites' navigation trees;
2. Parsing: for parsing sites according to the dictionary;
3. Charts: for results visualisation;
4. Artsy_genome_api: for collection of the marked up database of images (just links for now) from Artsy.net "The Genom Project";
5. Texts: for texts' processing and analysing.
